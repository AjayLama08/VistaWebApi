This is a text document! Isn't that shocking? I'm sure you're all amazed. I know I am. I mean, who would have thought that a text document would contain text? It's just so unexpected. I'm sure you're all on the edge of your seats, waiting to see what I'll type next. Will it be more text? Or will I switch things up and type some numbers instead? The possibilities are endless. The suspense is killing me. I can hardly contain myself. Oh, the excitement! The drama! The sheer unpredictability of it all! I just can't handle it. It's all too much for me. I think I need to lie down.
